Developed a Python-based command-line game inspired by the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" concept, featuring the options Snake, Water, and Gun. The player competes against the computer, with each making a random selection. The game determines the winner based on predefined rules: Snake drinks Water, Water douses Gun, and Gun kills Snake. The project demonstrates essential Python skills, including user input validation, use of control structures, and randomization with the random module. This game logic is efficiently organized to ensure clarity and modularity, highlighting my ability to create interactive and user-friendly Python applications.
